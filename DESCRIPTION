Description: This package is designed to aid in data analysis workflows. 
    Specifically, its intent is to aid with recoding categorical values in
    a dataset to ones that are more human-readable and/or appropriate for 
    analysis. It encourages the use of a user-generated codebook to assist 
    in documenting critical parts of the analysis in a way that is friendly 
    to collaborators, who are frequently non-R users.
